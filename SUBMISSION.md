## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Pixel-Perfect Color Matching
**Problem**: Figma colors needed accurate conversion to HSL  
**Solution**: Used Figma's inspect panel and converted to HSL format for better manipulation in CSS

### Challenge 2: Animation Timing
**Problem**: Balancing performance with smooth animations  
**Solution**: Used CSS transitions for simple interactions, Framer Motion for complex sequences

### Challenge 3: Keyboard Navigation
**Problem**: Ensuring intuitive keyboard flow  
**Solution**: Implemented logical tab order, Enter/Space handlers, and visible focus indicators

## Future Enhancements

If given more time, I would add:

1. **Responsive Design** - Mobile and tablet layouts
2. **Question Bank** - Support for multiple quiz categories
3. **Backend Integration** - Save scores, user profiles
4. **Timer Mode** - Timed quiz variant
5. **Social Sharing** - Share results on social media
6. **Analytics** - Track user performance and patterns
7. **Internationalization** - Multi-language support
8. **Dark Mode** - Theme switching capability
